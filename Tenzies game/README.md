<h2>Optimatizations:</h2>
<p><i>(Optional)</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a rolls section that displays how many times user has rolled the dice.
  <li>Adding a maximum rolls per game - Like game levels.
  <li>Allow the user to choose how challenging they want to play.
  <li>Make it multiplayer? We can use libraries like Socket (io to acheive this).
